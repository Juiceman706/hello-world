Fingers are crossed for good luck. Hoping learning all of this ends up becoming of something profitable or just fun in the long run. I've always been a sort of nerd, especially when it comes to electronics. Computers, software, Android and the whole big sha-bang that is my current place in time, is really something to learn and aquire if at all possible, and that is my goal, to start from scratch, at the very bottom, and build an imagination, a figmented picture in my brain, into reality.
